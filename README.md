# colorSpaceConversionPyScript
In this script, we read an image and create different variations of it by applying various color space conversions using Python and the OpenCV library.

We define the color conversions in a dictionary and use Python's itertools.permutations function to generate all possible sequences of these conversions.

After each conversion sequence, we save the resulting image. 

This script is so basic but it generates what i need.
